    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Onion, chopped</li>
        <li>Garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>Tomato Pureé</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Cook the Pasta:</em> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><em>Brown the Beef:</em> In a large skillet or saucepan, heat a little oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook, stirring and breaking it up with a spoon, until it's no longer pink. Remove the beef from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li><em>Sauté the Vegetables:</em> In the same pan, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Cook over medium heat until the onion is soft and translucent.</li>
        <li><em>Combine Beef and Vegetables:</em> Return the cooked beef to the pan with the onions and garlic.</li>
        <li><em>Add Tomatoes:</em> Stir in the canned tomatoes and tomato paste. Mix well to combine.</li>
        <li><em>Season the Sauce:</em> Season with salt and pepper. You can also add a pinch of dried herbs like basil or oregano if you have them.</li>
        <li><em>Simmer the Sauce:</em> Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer gently for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the sauce is too thick, add a little water.</li>
        <li><em>Combine Pasta and Sauce:</em> Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce, tossing to coat the pasta evenly. Alternatively, you can serve the sauce over the pasta.</li>
        <li><em>Check for Seasoning:</em> Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        <li><em>Serve:</em> Serve hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
